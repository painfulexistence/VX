# VX
![voxel engine screenshot](.github/media/screenshot.PNG)
This is a voxel engine written in Python using Pygame and ModernGL. I followed this amazing [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ab8TOSFfNp4) from Coder Space, and then deviated to experiment with modern rendering techniques, such as physically-based bloom, hopefully to create more unique and interesting visuals.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
### Running the project
```sh
uv run main.py
```

## TODOs
- [] Texture atlas and PBR materials
- [] Lights and IBL
- [] Light temperature
- [] Sun scattering fog
- [] Add capsule collider and terrain collision
- [] Switch between fly cam and first person cam
